Beautiful birthday website with countdown, photo gallery, and celebration effects!

## ��� Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173`

---

## ✏️ Customize

### 1. Birthday Date ⏰

**File:** `src/components/Countdown.jsx` (Line 21)

```javascript
const targetDate = new Date("2025-12-18T00:00:00");
```

**Format Explanation:**
```
"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"
 ↓    ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓
 Year Mo Day Hr Min Sec
```

- **YYYY** = 4-digit year (2025, 2026, etc.)
- **MM** = 2-digit month (01=Jan, 02=Feb, ... 12=Dec)
- **DD** = 2-digit day (01 to 31)
- **T** = Separator (keep this!)
- **HH:MM:SS** = Time in 24-hour format

**Time Examples:**
| What you want | Use this |
|---------------|----------|
| Midnight (12:00 AM) | `00:00:00` |
| 9:00 AM | `09:00:00` |
| Noon (12:00 PM) | `12:00:00` |
| 3:30 PM | `15:30:00` |
| 11:59 PM | `23:59:00` |

**Real Examples:**
```javascript
// January 15, 2026 at midnight
const targetDate = new Date("2026-01-15T00:00:00");

// June 10, 2025 at 3:30 PM
const targetDate = new Date("2025-06-10T15:30:00");

// December 25, 2025 at noon
const targetDate = new Date("2025-12-25T12:00:00");
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ `2025-1-5` → ✅ `2025-01-05` (always 2 digits)
- ❌ `2025/12/25` → ✅ `2025-12-25` (use dashes, not slashes)
- ❌ Missing T → ✅ Must have `T` between date and time

---

### 2. Names & Message

**File:** `src/components/MessageCard.jsx` (Lines 17-28)

```javascript
const recipientName = "Divyanshi";
const senderName = "Ashmit";
const message = `Your message here...`;
```

---

### 3. Photos

Add 6 photos to `public/images/` named: `pic1.jpg` to `pic6.jpg`

---

### 4. Music (Optional)

Replace `public/music.mp3` with your song

3. **Find Local Storage:**
   - In the left sidebar, look for "Local Storage"
   - Click the ▶ arrow to expand it
   - Click on `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Delete the Data:**
   - You'll see a row with key: `birthdayReached`
   - Right-click on it
   - Click "Delete"

5. **Refresh the Page:**
   - Press `Ctrl + R` (or `Cmd + R` on Mac)
   - The countdown should appear again!

**Visual Guide:**
```
Developer Tools (F12)
    ↓
